# Pull Request Template Helper

So I really like this pull request template I made. You can read about it
[here](http://quickleft.com/blog/pull-request-templates-make-code-review-easier).
This chrome extension pops up a little icon in your url bar when you're on a
pull request. If you click it, it'll insert it into the pull request body.

The benefit of this over a bookmarklet? It will dynamically fetch the content
of your PR template from the configured location, without having issues with
cross-origin policy.

Thanks to Rémi (in the comments of blog post above) for the idea!


WARNING: This extension is a big hack that was finished over an evening. Don't
judge me based on this code.
